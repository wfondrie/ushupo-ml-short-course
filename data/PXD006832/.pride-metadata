The fragmentation characteristics of the peptides can also be used to calibrate and compare collision energies between mass spectrometers. The sequences of all selected peptides do not occur in any natural protein, thus eliminating the need for stable isotope labeling and allowing straightforward integration into standard peptide identification strategies employing database searching or spectral library matching.", "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Peptides were were individually synthesized by SPOT Fmoc-based solid phase synthesis strategy.  Peptides were HPCL purified and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis using different gradient lenghts and steepness.", "dataProcessingProtocol": "Parts of the acquired MS data were searched against UniprotKB (human, 88,380 entries, version 07/13) supplemented with the sequences of the ProPep peptides) using MaxQuant 1.5.3.30 and default settings. Extraction of retention times and ion chromatograms was performed using Skyline 3.6.0.
